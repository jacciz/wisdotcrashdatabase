# wisdotcrashdatabase

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of wisdotcrashdatabase is to make data pulls and data analysis much easier. At my job, it is a SAS environment. I switched to R for my analysis. To set up an R environment, I converted the entire database into CSVs. I wrote automated scripts for these. Haven package is an option, but a couple things were not working properly. This package has functions to get certain crash flags, relabel by age or injury type for easier grouping.

## Installation

This package will never be released to CRAN as it's used internally at WisDOT.

The package can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jacciz/wisdotcrashdatabase")
```
## Importing data

This is done with one function:

```{r example}
library(wisdotcrashdatabase)
get_db_data(filepath = "C:/CSV/csv_from_sas/fst/", db_type = "crash", years_old = c("15", "16"), years = c("17","18"),  columns = c("ROLE"))
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
